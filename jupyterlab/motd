Welcome to the LSST Jupyterlab demo environment.

The LSST stack is in:

        /opt/lsst/software/stack

If you want to add your own configuration to LSST stack startup in the
LSST iPython kernel, create a sourceable shell fragment in:

        ${HOME}/notebooks/.user_setups

and it will be sourced during kernel startup.

To create an LSST environment in a terminal session:

        source /opt/lsst/software/stack/loadLSST.bash
